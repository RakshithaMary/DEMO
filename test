Perfect — for a **new server request**, what your infra / platform / IT team usually wants is **formal, audit-ready documentation**, not code-level notes.

Below is a **server-request–ready document** you can submit (or paste into a ticket / Confluence / Word / PDF).
I’ve written it in a **professional enterprise tone**, aligned with banking / regulated environments.

| Node.js          | Optional (only if frontend build is required) |
| Network          | Outbound connectivity to Neo4j server         |

---

## 5. Application Ports & Access

| Component   | Port     | Protocol     | Direction |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Backend API | 8000     | HTTP         | Inbound   |
| Frontend UI | 80 / 443 | HTTP / HTTPS | Inbound   |
| Neo4j DB    | 7701     | Bolt+s       | Outbound  |

---

## 6. Database Server Details

### Database Type

**Neo4j (Graph Database)**

### Connection Details

* **Protocol:** `bolt+s`
* **Host:** `neojocbplapp001.srv.bmogc.net`
* **Port:** `7701`
* **Database Name:** `usb2bgraphstg`

### Connection URI

```text
bolt+s://neojocbplapp001.srv.bmogc.net:7701
```

### Authentication

* Username: Application-specific service account
* Password: Stored securely (not hardcoded)

### Security

* TLS-encrypted connection
* Credentials stored via environment variables / secret manager
* No database write operations performed by application

---

## 7. Application Configuration (Environment Variables)

The application is configured using environment variables stored outside source control.

### Required Environment Variables

```env
NEO4J_URI="bolt+s://neojocbplapp001.srv.bmogc.net:7701"
NEO4J_USER="<service-account>"
NEO4J_PASSWORD="<secure-password>"
NEO4J_DATABASE="usb2bgraphstg"
```

### Configuration Notes

* No secrets are committed to source control
* Environment variables loaded at runtime
* Credentials can be rotated without redeploying code

---

## 8. Software Dependencies

### Backend (Python)

* fastapi
* uvicorn
* neo4j
* pydantic
* python-dotenv (if applicable)

Dependencies installed via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend

* Cytoscape.js (graph visualization)
* FontAwesome (icons)
* Native JavaScript / HTML / CSS

---

## 9. Application Start & Run

### Backend Startup

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend Hosting

* Static files served via:

  * Nginx / Apache OR
  * Python static server

---

## 10. Security & Compliance Considerations

* Read-only access to Neo4j
* No PII modification
* No credentials stored in code
* TLS enforced for database connectivity
* Access controlled via network and server-level permissions

---

## 11. Monitoring & Logging (Optional)

* Application logs via stdout / file logging
* Can integrate with centralized logging if required
* Health check available via FastAPI endpoint

---

## 12. Support & Ownership

| Area        | Owner                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Application | Knowledge Graph Team        |
| Database    | Neo4j Platform Team         |
| Server      | Infrastructure / Cloud Team |

---

## 13. Summary of Request

We request provisioning of a **new application server** with the specifications outlined above to host the Knowledge Graph Explorer.
The server will host a Python FastAPI backend and a static frontend, connecting securely to an existing Neo4j database.

---

### ✅ Next Steps
